       "\"The proofreading status of neurons that have been comprehensively proofread as of Materialization v117. Axon and dendrite compartment status are marked separately under 'axon_status' and 'dendrite_status', as proofreading effort was applied differently to the different compartments in some cells. There are three possible status values for each compartment: 'non' indicates no comprehensive proofreading. 'clean' indicates that all false merges have been removed, but all tips have not necessarily been followed. 'extended' indicates that the cell is both clean and all tips have been followed as far as a proofreader was able to. The 'pt_position' is at a cell body or similar core position for the cell. The column 'valid_id' provides the root id when the proofreading was last checked. If the current root id in 'pt_root_id' is not the same as 'valid_id', there is no guarentee that the proofreading status is correct. Very small false axon merges (axon fragments approximately 5 microns or less in length) were considered acceptable for clean neurites. Note that this table does not list all edited cells, but only those with comprehensive effort toward the status mentioned here. Table compiled by Casey Schneider-Mizell, including work by many proofreaders and data maintained by Stelios Papadopoulos.\""

    "Now we are ready to query synapses for this neuron. Because the analysis database can, in principle, handle multiple different sources of synapses, we have to specify which synapse table we want to use. The current table holding the most up to date automated synapse detection is called `synapses_pni_2`.  The \"info\" service has this information however, so we don't need to remember it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because synapses are such a common query, we have written a wrapper method `synapse_query` which makes uses the default synapse table and simplifies the syntax. So, we can specify which synapses we get back from the table by setting the `post_ids` argument to a list of IDs, which makes a query that only returns synapses whose postsynaptic id is the one selected.  You can also filter by `pre_ids` which will do the same for the pre-synaptic side. Setting this will only return synapses that are from certain neurons.  Setting both `pre_ids` and `post_ids` will return only synapses that are from the `pre_ids` onto the `post_ids`.\n",

    "Ok, you are probably really fried by now, but here is one important thing to remember about this meshworks object. The meshworks object contains a mesh with lots of vertices and a skeleton which holds a subset of these vertices. Therefore, in python these points have different \"indices\" in the mesh and skeleton. For example, if the mesh contains 10000 vertices, the indexing of those would run from 0 - 9999. The skeleton, which contains a subset of 100 of these would have indexing from 0-99. How would you figure out which of the mesh vertices these correspond to?\n",
